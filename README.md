# Sudoku-Solving-using-Constraint-Satisfaction-Algorithm


The variables in our constraint-satisfaction problem is the empty space in Sudoku. 

The domains are numbers from 0 to 9.

The constraints are no entry in row, column and 3x3 box is same.

This is the Sudoku solving problem. The constraints are that the numbers in column, row and box should not be the same. For doing this we have first defined the CSP algorithm in which we have defined the variables, Domains and constraints. Using Backtrack search algorithm we are satidfying the constraints. And then we have defined our sudoku solving problem and defined variables, domains and the constraints for this problem. Then we are also looking for consistency and all.
